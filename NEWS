Release 0.99.9 (not finished yet, David)
Changes:
    + (r42509) Add methods "replaceDetector", "replaceSample", "removeSample", "removeDetector". Not documented nor tested yet, therefore internal for now. 
    + (r42528) 'replaceDetector', 'replaceSample', 'removeSample' and 'removeDetector' have been thoroughly tested and documented

Release 0.99.8 (2009-10-02, David)

API Changes
    + replaced hardcoded label 'NA' for undetectable values with 'ND'

Release 0.99.5 (2009-08-12)
API Changes
    + '[' method of 'SDMFrame' objcet returns an object of SDMFrame with the data subset (formly it returns the data.frame)
    + '[' method does not raise warnings any more by dropping the index parameter names
    + 'Ct' has now a method for the 'SDMFrame' object, returns a vector of Ct values in the SDMframe core data.
    + 'SDMFrame' object can be converted to data.frame by 'as.data.frame' (S3 method)
Internal Changes:
    + 'ddCtExec' is modified to adapt to the API changes.
Documentation:
    + The above changes have been reflected in the documentation
Bug Fixes:
    + The 'ddCtErrBarchart' method checks whether all the expression values are 'NA', if so it stops execution.

Release 0.99.4 (2009-08-06)
Documentation
    + Vignette uses 'verbatim' instead of 'listings' package to show script codes, since the Windows server of Bioconductor does not install the package.

Release 0.99.3 (2009-08-04)
New feature
    + 'rightCensoring' method is added. It performs the right censoring of the
    Ct value and sets those values above a given threshold as NA or other given
    value 
API Changes
    + 'coreData' and 'coreData<-' methods are exported now for the SDMFrame-class

Release 0.99.2 (2009-08-04)
API Changes
    + 'withoutPath' slot is removed from the 'SDMFrame' class.
Bug Fixes
    + 'warningStream' parameter is really passed in the 'ddCtExpression'
    function. This parameter was neglected in the older version.
