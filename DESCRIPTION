Description: The Delta-Delta-Ct (ddCt) Algorithm is an approximation method to determine relative gene expression with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments. Compared to other approaches, it requires no standard curve for each primer-target pair, therefore reducing the working load and yet returning accurate enough results as long as the assumptions of the amplification efficiency hold. The ddCt package implements a pipeline to collect, analyse and visualize qRT-PCR results, for example those from TaqMan SDM software, mainly using the ddCt method. The pipeline can be either invoked by a script in command-line or through the API consisting of S4-Classes, methods and functions.
